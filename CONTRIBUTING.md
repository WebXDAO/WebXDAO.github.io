# Contributing Guidelines

üéâ **First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute!** üéâ

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct üìú

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/WebXDAO/WebXDAO.github.io/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to one of our moderators via your preferred platform or in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/TSRwqx4K2v).

## How can I contribute? ü§î

### Reporting Bugs üí£

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report üìù, reproduce the behavior üíª üíª, and find related reports üîé

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Suggesting Enhancements üõ†

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion üìù and find related suggestions üîé.

Since the new GitHub Issue forms we only suggest you to include most information possible. But you can also **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/WebXDAO/WebXDAO.github.io/issues)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Your First Code Contribution üü©

Unsure where to begin contributing to this project? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner-friendly issues](https://github.com/WebXDAO/WebXDAO.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/WebXDAO/WebXDAO.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests üì£

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the project's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible!
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions

Please follow all instructions in [the template](https://github.com/WebXDAO/WebXDAO.github.io/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md)

## Style Guide for Git Commit Messages :memo:

**How you can add more value to your contribution logs:**

- Use the present tense. (Example: "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood. (Example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Limit the first line (also called the Subject Line) to *50 characters or less*.
- Capitalize the Subject Line.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Wrap the body at *72 characters*.
- Use the body to explain the *what*, *why*, *vs*, and *how*.
- Reference [Issues](https://github.com/WebXDAO/WebXDAO.github.io/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/WebXDAO/WebXDAO.github.io/pulls) liberally after the first line.
- Follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
